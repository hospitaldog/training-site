How To Move Multiple segments of pipe at one time
Disconnect a segment pipe ( Select 2 vertice and move the line)
Highlight pipe that is being moved
Select move tool
Hold Ctrl , press the left key on mouse and hold
Let go of Ctrl button
Go to Edit menu in the Tools Ribbon select Move
Wait for YELLOW DOT

SELF QC Guideleines- Heat # Sorting
SELF QC
Select by attributes
Detail Pipe
WORKORDERID = "XXXXXXXXX"
Right click any column
click advanced sorting
Sort By : Outside Diameter
Sort By: Heat Number
Heat numbers are usually unique so OD/WT/GRADE/SEAM etc should be the same.
Measures/routeid/orientation will be different since they are located on different facility
lines at different measures flowing in different directions.
Analyze each group of heat numbers to make sure the attributes are correct.
If you find that a heat number is showing different attributes in your table, go to the source
documents and re-check that you have the correct heat number at that location on the heat
map.

Work Order Checklist
1) When receiving a Work Order you should have an ASBUILT PROJECT CHECK LIST with an hour count.
a) Determine Group Classification. (INTRA = Gathering; INTER = Transmission, Liquid)
(If No checklist, ask Leads for a print out of check list and hour count.)
2) Begin researching project using your documentation resources. ( Web Links: Filenet, Project Pulse,
Caddata Drive)
a. Find Location using coordinates X,Y, Imagery (GMAP, google map,
google earth), System Name if given etc.
b. What is your project doing? Look for Completion Report,
Authorization for Expenditure, GForms etc.
c. Look for redline drawings, iso drawings, survey notes, hydro test,
MAOP sheet etc.
i. See Document Checklist
3) Check ArcMap for newer projects or your current project to see if it has been asbuilted.
a) If your work order is older, make sure there are no newer projects in the area you are working
on.
4) Prep Your Work
5) ArcMap Data Entry (ETE Asbuilt Tools, populating fields with the material attributes you gathered for
pipe, coating, pressure verification “hydro Test”, MAOP, fittings, valves, fieldnotes, boundaries etc.
6) Reconcile, Save, Post.
7) MicroStation if needed.
8) Create or Regenerate Alignment Sheets. (First check for existing sheets in Hello! Sheets)
9) Self QC.
a) See Self QC Guidelines.
10) Turn in Project “Work Order” with your start date and hour count to Brittany.
